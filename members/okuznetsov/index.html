            <h1>Some stuff about me (5 days after the deadline, but better then nothing, right?)</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>I'm currently in my third year of master's studies in AI at FIT CTU.</li>
                <li>My primary professional field of interest is ML and AI, mostly Large Language Models. I also have some experience with StableDiffusion.</li>
                <li>I have worked on GPT-related projects, data analysis, and visualization projects.</li>
                <li>Aside from my passion for AI, I also enjoy producing beats, DJing, and recording some ambience outside.</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <h1>What I want to try</h1>
            <p>Some interesting music stuff would be really awesome: 
                <ul>
                    <li>I have a field recorder + some AI skills + FL Studio.</li>
                    <li>We could use some real-world sounds as a foundation that can be processed and modified using some plugins and AI.</li>
                    <li>This also can be combined with some digital or real-world visual components.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>I'm also opened to new ideas, so if you have something interesting in your mind, we can discuss it.</p>
