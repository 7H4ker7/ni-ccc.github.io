    <h1>Hi! I'm xnomas</h1>
    <p class="tagline">I hack stuff</p>
    <p>I'm a student of computer security who really likes and works in cybersecurity. I am fascinated and really involved with hunting down malicious phishing sites. How could this relate to creative programming? Let me show you:</p>

    <p>This was created by Jindřich Karásek and hosted as NFTs on <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/art-of-cyber-security">opensea</a> and to me these images are beautiful. Data visualized, it tells a story.</p>
    <p>The data required to be able to make this is too much for a university project. But I would like to create something similar, either with scam advertizing (malwertizing) links and domains on Facebook etc. or with redirecting sites that use searched keywords to redirect a visitor to a malicious site... we've all seen them: "Spin the wheel!" stuff like that.</p>
    <p>Uhm. Yep. That's it.</p>
