    <h1>Veronika Kalouskov√°</h1>
    <p class="tagline">A confused newcomer</p>
    <p>Finished my bachelor's degree in computer science without any further specialization at the Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava. Even though my studies interest me, what I am the most passionate about are my rescue cats, and overall animal welfare. On the other hand what terrifies me the most is the climatic crisis and the role the human race plays in it. My interests include exploring new music, science fiction novels and movies - I like them aesthetically pleasing, for example like Blade Runner.</p>

    <h2>Ideas</h2>
    <p>Since I have no previous experience with visualization, apart from a short OpenGL demo and some Matlab work, I do not have any specific ideas nor have any idea what is actually possible, both time and experience wise.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I would be interested in doing any visualization concerning the climate change, perhaps of factors contributing to it. There is no specific idea in my head, it could be either informative, artsy or perhaps both.</li>
        <li>My friend who is studying a doctorate degree in art asked me for technical support with her upcoming installation. The central thesis being time, her idea is to capture the visitors faces and then project them as part of pre-recorded videos. She already found some working code using deep learning licensed under creative commons licence, but there are several problems - for starters the video resolution constraint is too small, or generating video taking too much time. She would probably also like to add some other features and make the whole process of taking the photo and generating the video automatic. Not sure how much work there is to do, and therefore if her idea is suitable for this project.</li>
    </ul>
