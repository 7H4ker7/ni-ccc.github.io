    <h2>I like to plan things. Little less to execute them.</h2>
    <p>I've studied knowledge engineering during the bachelor course and now continue on this path. I am also a scout leader, and do a lot of things that are related to that.</p>

    <h2>NI-CCC Project</h2>
    <p>My project proposal is to visualise time distances between places when using public transport. This seems trivial, but could help a lot.  
      To make it a little more interesting, I've come up with the following ideas:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Strictly use only open data. Strive to use the most universal formats possible.</li>
        <li>Make it modular. Visualising one city or another, or even a country or a larger region should really be the same if the data is standardized.</li>
        <li>Do some research and come up with fun metrics. Such as, what is the time distance to all other places in Prague, but at 3:15 in the morning. Or how far you can get with 120 Kc or something.</li>
        <li>Make an editor, so that you can visualise what effect your new metro line would have if you route it as you intend it to way. Or so that you can visualise what effect would it have if a particular track would go out of order.</li>
        <li>Use real time data. This is scary, though. But interesting. But scary.</li>
    </ul>
