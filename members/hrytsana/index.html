               <h1>Anastasiia Solomiia Hrytsyna</h1>
               <p>
                  Nastiia. Instead of this long strange name, just call me Nastiia (always written with two 'i', not 'y' - it is important !).
                  Although this does not always help. Don't try to speak Czech with me quickly - I won't understand you, so I will just smile back.
                  Actually, I moved here recently, as before I finished Computer Science at FIIT STU in Bratislava. Therefore, I feel confident
                  pretending that I know Slovak well (but I don't). I am also passionate about medicine (as a child I dreamed of becoming a surgeon).
                  For this reason, I always try to combine my career in IT with it. This is not really relevant to our subject (the whole speech about
                  myself isn't...), but in case you are also interested how we can improve some methods of patients treatment - I will be happy to
                  talk to you.

         <h3>IDEAS</h3>
         <p id="ideas-desc">The description of my (possible) future semestral project</p>

         <p>
            Me with my friend have a common friend. He had birthday in July, but we still didn't manage to create a present for him. My bestie (btw,
            she is a psychologist, so she has to know for sure) recommended me to finish all of my beginnings... And that is why I decided to combine
            necessary stuff with useful and create a gift for a friend during this semester.
         </p>

         <p>
            We planned to do something similar to the picture. It's actually a simple tic-tac-toe game, just with a few our modifications (for
            example, figures with ability to rotate their position, some pieces to lock figures and so on). Previously, we made a decision to create
            this game from scratch, but there are a lot of things to do (create a 3D model of each figure and print them on a 3D printer, cut the
            playing field with the laser, create a box to pack the whole game...). I don't have an experience with such stuff, so I believe that
            during this semester I will be able to learn all of this and fulfill my plans.
