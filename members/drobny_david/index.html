    <p>
        I finished my bachelor's degree in FIIT STU in Bratislava, then worked as a DevSecOps engineer for a year. Now, I came back for some more pain in my life. Besides coding, I love going for hikes, chilling with friends and doing whatever I feel like doing.
    <h2>Ideas</h2>
    <p>
        I already have a few courses on games and VR. Also, I plan to work with AR in my master's thesis. I like to try and experiment with something of that nature. Maybe some 3D animations purely generated by code embedded into the VR/AR experience. Perhaps something more artsy and interactive. Maybe something completely different ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
